# FIND-Hydrogen-Alloy-NavigationDiscovery
FIND is a platform for hydrogen storage alloys that enables both forward prediction(from chemical formula and temperature to PCT properties)and inverse prediction(from properties back to chemical formula).Its advanced forward prediction feature also supports automatic prediction of PCT properties for alloy mixtures with varying mass ratios.
